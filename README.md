# hatch-fail-meta

Data and R script to run a phylogenetically corrected multilevel meta-analysis of hatching failure across wild, wild managed, and captive bird species of different threat classifications.

The script MetaAnalysis_Script.R contains all relevant R code. The final dataset used in the script is found in the csv file Appendix_S8_Dataset.csv. 1000 phylogenetic trees were downloaded from https://birdtree.org/ to complete the phylogenetic correction. The relevant file used in the R script is output.nex.
